# Kelly Nguyen's SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! Within this portfolio, you'll find a collection of projects and experiences that showcase my passion for working with databases as well as managing data. I hope this portfolio not only showcases my passion for SQL, but also serves as a resource for those looking to explore SQL in their data-related endeavors. Feel free to have a look around, ask questions, and get in touch with me for any inquiries or opportunities.
